# Floodwarning_system

Here is a program calling API to fetch flood and rain data, store it in a class and analyze it to give flood prediction and warning.

It is given as a coursework in part IA (first year) of Engineering course of Univeristy of Cambridge, and I completed it teamed up with
my lab partnerï¼Œ (which means only half of the code is completed by me).
